Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to contribute refactored code on websites by creating reusable functional components and reproduced design mock-ups. I also
set up forms designed to collect and store data inputs, linking them to Swagger APIs for seamless interaction with database tables.

            This was a valuable opportunity that helped me develop not just my React skills but also delved into the exploration and application of additional skills. I was able to get more practical knowledge and expertise with technologies like Redux, Ant Design, and Bootstrap during this trip. Throughout this time, I received a lot of practical experience that helped me improve as a front-end developer and equipped me with a diverse skill set that I can't wait to use on new projects.
